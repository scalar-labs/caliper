  * Added charting capabilities to the report generation ([PR#650](https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/pull/650)).
  * __BREAKING:__ Configuration structure for Docker and process monitoring changed ([PR#650](https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/pull/650)).
  * __BREAKING:__ Simplified (flattened) round settings in the benchmark configuration file, i.e., the YAML structure changed ([PR#639](https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/pull/639)).
  
* CLI changes
  * Added new SDK bindings for Fabric ([PR#742](https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/pull/742)).
  * __BREAKING:__ Changed the CLI commands. The binding command now accepts an external configuration file. The new launch commands can perform binding automatically ([PR#734](https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/pull/734), [PR#742](https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/pull/742)).

  * Relaxed the network configuration schema constraints for channel peers and registrars ([PR#733](https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/pull/733)).
  * Pass explicit Orderer objects when broadcasting a TX so the SDK won't create a new connection for each TX ([PR#731](https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/pull/731)).

* Ethereum/Hyperledger Besu adapter changes
  * Added support for HD keys ([PR#652](https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/pull/652)).
  * Gas estimation is now opt-in and secondary to explicit gas values. Nonces are only added if Caliper signs the TXs ([PR#640](https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/pull/640)).
  * Allow the network configuration to specify the gas values that each method call is allotted ([PR#627](https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/pull/627)).

* __DEPRECATED:__ The HL Composer adapter has been marked as deprecated and __will be removed__ in 0.3.0.
* __BREAKING:__ Added rigorous and strict validation for Fabric network configuration files. Some attributes became mutually exclusive, which might break your previous configuration files that relied on precedence between attributes ([PR#595](https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/pull/595)).
* __BREAKING:__ Improved the logging configuration flexibility. The default log message structure has changed, which might break your dependent (e.g. log mining) applications ([PR#598](https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/pull/595), [PR#607](https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/pull/607)).
* __BREAKING:__ Made report file path configurable. The default report path has changed, which might break your dependent applications ([PR#601](https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/pull/601)).
* Added support for Ethereum ([PR#432](https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/pull/432))
* Added support for Hyperledger Besu ([PR#616](https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/pull/616))

* Added the `querySmartContract` function to the `Blockchain` interface ([PR#578](https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/pull/578)). _The old `queryState` function will be deprecated and removed in the upcoming releases (once every adapter supports the new function)!_
* Introduced observers for continuous status updates about the running benchmark ([PR#588](https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/pull/588)).
* Added a Prometheus-based observer and monitor ([PR#588](https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/pull/588)).
